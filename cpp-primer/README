Problem:
~~~~~~~~

An ant is placed at the origin of a 2-D surface and will be taking steps that zig-zag through the
space as follows:

    16  .......
     |
    15 - 14 - 13 - 12
                    |
     4 -  5 -  6   11
     |         |    |
     3 -  2    7   10
          |    |    |
     0 -  1    8 -  9

You need to write a program that takes a list of distances (each representing a number of step)
and prints the (x,y) coordinates for each distance on a separate line

for example:

./p1 0
0 (0,0)

./p1 1
1 (1,0)

./p1 2
2 (1,1)

./p1 0 1 2 1000000
0 (0,0)
1 (1,0)
2 (1,1)
1000000 (0,1000)

Rules
~~~~~

- Your program has to finish in 5 seconds or less
- Distance is in the range 0 to 1,000,000,000,000

Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The test file contains the arguments to be passed to the program and the ok file contains the
expected output. For example:

bob.test
0 1 2 1000000

bob.ok
0 (0,0)
1 (1,0)
2 (1,1)
1000000 (0,1000)

To compile:
~~~~~~~~~~~

    make

To run tests:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make clean test

To make the output less noisy:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s clean test
