My projects in the Computer Architecture and Prediction Mechanisms courses at UT Austin.

# Arm Instruction Emulator
AArch64 instruction subset emulator. Supports 20 instructions.

# C-Routines
API for communicating sequential processes (CSP) called c-routines.

# Instruction Pipelining
Pipelined cpu architecture with word addressable memory in verilog.

# Malloc/Free
Malloc/Free using a linked list representation of memory blocks.

# Optimized Arm Instruction Emulator
Optimized AArch64 instruction subset emulator. 10x faster.

# Single Cycle CPU
Single-cycle cpu architecture with byte addressable memory in verilog.

# Branch Prediction
Instruction branch predictor logic to be used in ChampSim.

# Cache Replacement
Cache replacement policies to be used in ChampSim.

# Machine Learning Branch Prediction
Branch prediction using machine learning classifiers.
