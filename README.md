AArch64 instruction subset emulator. Supports 20 instructions.

# C-Routines
API for communicating sequential processes (CSP) called c-routines.

# Instruction Pipelining
Pipelined cpu architecture with word addressable memory in verilog.

# Malloc/Free
malloc/free using a linked list representation of memory blocks.

# Optimized Arm Instruction Emulator
Optimized AArch64 instruction subset emulator. 10x faster.

# Single Cycle CPU
Single-cycle cpu architecture with byte addressable memory in verilog.
